# Chapter 1.1 - Steam TOTP
As you probably already know, Steam has made 2FA mandatory now. This can fortunately be automatized 
using [Doctor McKay's Steam TOTP](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-totp). 

To install this you can simply do npm install steam-totp and you should be ready to go. 

```js
const SteamUser = require('steam-user');
const SteamTotp = require('steam-totp'),

const client = new SteamUser();

const logOnOptions = {
	accountName: 'your_steam_username',
	password: 'your_steam_password',
  twoFactorCode : SteamTotp.generateAuthCode('your_steam_shared_secret')
};

client.logOn(logOnOptions);

client.on('loggedOn', () => {
	console.log('Logged into Steam');
});
```

If done correctly, running 'node project1.js` will now automatically make the bot login without the need of 
manually entering the code.

### Modules
All that was simply added was const SteamTotp = require('steam-totp'); which will include the SteamTotp module. 
Then in the logOnOptions object we added twoFactorCode : SteamTotp.generateAuthCode('your_steam_shared_secret').
The twoFactorCode key will therefore generate the 2FA code utilizing your shared secret. 

### How To Find Your Secrets
You might be wondering were to find the shared secret and there are actually many tutorials depending on your 
device. If you are on iphone you can try [this](http://forums.backpack.tf/index.php?/topic/45995-guide-how-to-get-your-shared-secret-from-ios-device-steam-mobile/) method while if you are using android
you can try [this](https://github.com/SMVampire/SteamBotDev/wiki/Getting-Shared-Secret-from-Android-(Windows)) tutorial. All that you have to know
is that the shared secret is used to login, while the identity secret is used for confirmations, but we will use 
the identity secret later on when we it will be necessary. Remember to never show these secrets to anyone as they
could easily sabotage your account.
